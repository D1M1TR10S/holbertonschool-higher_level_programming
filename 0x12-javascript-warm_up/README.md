## Description
Be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

 - Why Javascript programming is amazing (don’t forget to tweet today, with the hashtag #javascriptisamazing :))
 - How to run a Javascript script
 - How to create variables and constants
 - What are differences between var, const and let
 - What are all the data types available in Javascript
 - How to use the if, if ... else statements
 - How to use comments
 - How to affect values to variables
 - How to use while and for loops
 - How to use break and continue statements
 - What is a function and how do you use functions
 - What does return a function that does not use any return statement
 - Scope of variables
 - What are the arithmetic operators and how to use them
 - How to manipulate dictionary
 - How to import a file

### 0. First constant, first print
Write a script that prints “Javascript is amazing”:

Run: ./0-javascript\_is\_amazing.js

### 1. 3 languages
Write a script that prints 3 lines:
 - The first line: “C is fun”
 - The second line: “Python is cool”
 - The third line: “Javascript is amazing”
 - You must use console.log(...) to print all output

Run: ./1-multi\_languages.js

### 2. Arguments
Write a script that prints a message depending of the number of arguments passed:
 - If no arguments are passed to the script, print “No argument”
 - If only one argument is passed to the script, print “Argument found”
 - Otherwise, print “Arguments found”

Run: ./2-arguments.js Holberton
Result: Argument Found

### 3. Value of my argument
Write a script that prints the first argument passed to it:
 - If no arguments are passed to the script, print “No argument”
 - You must use console.log(...) to print all output

### 4. Create a sentence
Write a script that prints two arguments passed to it, in the following format: “ is ”

Run: ./4-concat.js c cool

### 5. An Integer
Write a script that prints My number: <first argument converted in integer> if the first argument can be converted to an integer.

Run: ./5-to\_integer.js 89
Result: My number: 89

### 6. Loop to languages
Write a script that prints 3 lines: (like 1-multi\_languages.js) but by using an array of string and a loop

### 7. I love C
Write a script that prints x times “C is fun”

### 8. Square
Write a script that prints a square
 - The first argument is the size of the square
 - If the first argument can’t be converted to an integer, print “Missing size"
 - You must use the character X to print the square

### 9. Add
Write a script that prints the addition of 2 integers
 - The first argument is the first integer
 - The second argument is the second integer
 - You have to define a function with this prototype: function add(a, b)

### 10. Factorial
Write a script that computes and prints a factorial
 - The first argument is integer (argument can be cast as integer) used for computing the factorial
 - Factorial of NaN is 1
 - You must do it recursively
 - You must use a function

### 11. Second biggest!
Write a script that searches the second biggest integer in the list of arguments.
 - You can assume all arguments can be converted to integer
 - If no argument passed, print 0
 - If the number of arguments is 1, print 0

### 12. Object
Update this script to replace the value 12 with 89:
 - You are not allowed to use var

### 13. Add file
Write a function that returns the addition of 2 integers.
 - The function must be visible from outside
 - The name of the function must be add
 - You are not allowed to use var
